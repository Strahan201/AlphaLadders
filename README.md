# AlphaLadders
Allows you to use spaced ladders like you could in alpha

Pretty basic.  When you climb a ladder, if there is a non ladder space above you but a ladder above that, it will set a 
Y positive velocity on you to boost you up to the next ladder.  This will allow you to climb the "alpha" style material
efficient ladder setups where you could skip every other block.  

I made this cuz I was exploring an old alpha map and did not want to waste my time fixing every ladder set I came to :)
